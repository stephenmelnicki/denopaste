[Fresh](https://fresh.deno.dev) üçã

## Getting Started

Install the latest [Deno CLI](https://deno.land) version.

Then start the development server using the `deno task` command:

```sh
deno task dev
```

Now open http://localhost:8000 in your browser to view Deno Paste. Any changes
you make to the source code will be reflected in your browser.

Deno Paste is deployed via [Deno Deploy](https://deno.com/deploy). To deploy
your own version:

1. Fork this repository
2. [Create a Deno Deploy project](https://dash.deno.com/new)
3. [Link] the Deno Deploy project to the `main.ts` file
4. The project will be deployed to a public $project.deno.dev subdomain.

For a more in-depth getting started guide, visit the
[Getting Started](https://fresh.deno.dev/docs/getting-started) page in the Fresh
docs.

## Testing

Two varieties of tests are present, unit and integration tests.

To run the unit tests:

```sh
deno task test
```

To generate a test coverage report:

```sh
deno task coverage
open ./coverage/html/index.html
```

In order to run the integration tests, you'll first need to start the Deno Paste
server if it isn't already running:

```sh
deno task build
deno task preview
```

Then run the integration tests headlessly:

```sh
deno task e2e
```

You can also run the integration tests with the browser open:

```sh
deno task e2e -- --headful
```
